# We will be using wieghts derrived from Regression to make model for our bio sensor, modelling will be done using brian2.
# We will then use the model on training dataset to get the desired output and scores will be compared will ML model.

# Basically We have to show that our model works better than ML model to show that our biosensor is something better.
